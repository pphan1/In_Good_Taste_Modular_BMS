# In_Good_Taste_Modular_BMS

## Setup
The instructions on the [UVA Solar Car Team Website](https://solarcaratuva.github.io/stm32-mbed-info) were used to help setup this project. The [PlatformIO IDE](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/pioide.html) was installed using a VSCode extension.

The ST Link Driver may be needed to upload the program to the Nucleo-F413ZH. This driver can be found [here](https://os.mbed.com/teams/ST/wiki/ST-Link-Driver).
